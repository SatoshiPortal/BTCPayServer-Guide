# Get Inbound Capacity

In order to be able to receive payments over the Lightning Network, you must have inbound liquidity to your node. To do this, you can either add Bitcoin to your Lightning wallet and open a channel with other Lightning Network nodes, or you can use a service provider that will grant you inbound liquidity for a small fee.

#### Getting inbound liquidity with a service provider:

Get your node information so that the service provider knows with whom to open a channel with. To do this, go to:&#x20;
