# Withdrawing Your Bitcoins

There are two options to withdraw bitcoins that will be presented. There are multiple other ways, but they are significantly more complicated.

### Option 1 : Sell bitcoins for fiat with Bull Bitcoin

{% hint style="success" %}
On [bullbitcoin.com](https://bullbitcoin.com) , you can sell your bitcoins using the Lightning network and receive fiat in any Canadian bank account, or pay a bill on the same or next business day.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Just click on the `Sell Bitcoin` button on the left-hand menu, and select the `Lightning Network` as your payment network. Copy the payment invoice and paste it into your Ride the Lightning (RTL) Wallet payment section.

#### **On RTL wallet:**

1. Under `Lightning`, click on `Transactions`.

2. Under `Payments`, click on `Send Payment` (you donâ€™t need to touch the Advanced Options).

3. Enter the Payment Request and click `Send Payment.`

### Option 2 : Sends bitcoins to an external wallet to convert into on-chain Bitcoin

#### Wallet 1 : BlueWallet

Once you created a Lightning wallet in BlueWallet, create an invoice to paste into RTL by clicking on `Receive`(as in the instructions described above).

Once you have funds in your Lightning wallet, click on `Manage Funds` (in the Lightning wallet).

Now click on `Exchange`. This will open up a website where you can send Bitcoin on the Lightning Network and they will send you an equivalent minus fees to a Bitcoin address that you provide.&#x20;

#### Wallet 2 : Breez Wallet

Once you created a Lightning wallet in Breez Wallet, create an Invoice to paste into RTL by clicking on `Receive`(as in the instructions described above).

{% hint style="warning" %}
They will charge a small processing fee that is only applicable to the first transaction.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Now that you have bitcoins in your Lightning wallet, click on `Send`.
* Select `Send to BTC address`.
* Enter your address and confirm the transaction.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
They have a system where it looks like they treat on-chain BTC and Lightning BTC as if they were the same, but there is a _swap_ going on behind the scenes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using the Bull Bitcoin hosting service, please contact your account manager to withdraw funds.&#x20;
