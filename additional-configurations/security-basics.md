# Configuring Users

It's recommended that server admins [configure SMTP settings](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/FAQ/ServerSettings/#how-to-configure-smtp-settings-in-btcpay). Email setup enables easier password reset for the instance users in case of forgotten credentials.

To allow other users to access your server, you need to enable registration in `Server Settings > Policies`.
