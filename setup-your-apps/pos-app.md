# POS App

Allows users with brick and mortar stores to readily **accept bitcoin without fees or a third-party**, directly to their wallet. The **PoS** can be displayed easily on tablets or any other devices which support web browsing. Users can easily create a homescreen shortcut for a quick access to the web-app.

Adding new products is easy. The app has a **shopping cart feature**, **tips**, **product inventory**, **custom payment options** and more.

The **Point of sale app** can also be used to receive donations, tips or even as a small e-commerce shop, depending on the options or customizations applied.

Curently, the **Point of Sale app** supports three different views:

* A `Static` view representing only the items for sale.
* A `Cart` view including items for sale and a cart for checkout.
* A `Light` view consisting only of a keypad for easy and quick payments.

To get your first **Point of Sale app** running, follow theses few simple steps:

1. Go to `Apps` and `Create a new app`
2. Add a `name` for your app
3. Choose `app type` > Point Of Sale
4. Select the `store` to associate with the app.
5. Click on `Settings` to modify the elements in the store.&#x20;
6. Customize your PoS by choosing a `view` (Static, Cart, Light), adding your own `items` with prices, photos, and a description.
7. Click `Save Settings`.
8. Click `View App` to view your PoS (Your customers can access the PoS through that link).
