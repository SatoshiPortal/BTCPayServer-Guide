# Use Your Own Hardware

There are several options which enable you to host BTCPay Server on your own hardware device. You can either build the device yourself or purchase it pre-assembled.

Once the hardware in hand, you can then select the service (some offer free versions) you'd like to use to download and manage your node:&#x20;

* [My Node](https://mynodebtc.com);
* [Embassy](https://start9.com/latest/) by Start9;
* [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com);
* [Lightning in a Box](https://lightninginabox.co);
* [Nodl](https://www.nodl.it).

Build or buy any one of the above nodes to begin using BTCPay Server on your self-hosted device.

BTCPay Server also provides instructions for setting up your self-hosted server from scratch, but his method is much more technically advanced. [Find it here](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Deployment/Hardware/).
