# Bull Bitcoin Hosting

This option avoids deploying or building your own node and greatly accelerates and simplifies the process of getting your own BTCPay Server up and running.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You avoid the time it takes for your server to be fully synced, you do not need any technical know-how and you do not need to deal with maintenance.
{% endhint %}

If this is an option you'd like to use, please [contact us](mailto:contact@bullbitcoin.com) so that we can get you onboarded. You can refer to the rest of this guide in order to know how to connect your wallet and customize your shop.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you wish to enable Lightning,  note that this is a custodial service and you will need to contact your account manager to withdraw funds from there. Accepting on-chain Bitcoin payments is entirely self-custodial.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
