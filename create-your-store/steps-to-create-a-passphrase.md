# Build Your Store

When using your own hosting solution, you can create an unlimited number of stores, with each one connected to a wallet.&#x20;

They can also each have apps, like Point of Sale, Payment Buttons and Crowdfunding, or be tied to an external e-commerce software.&#x20;

Make sure that you are first logged into your account. Then go to:

1. Stores;
2. Click on `Create a New Store`;
3. Enter the store name;
4. Click on `Create`.
